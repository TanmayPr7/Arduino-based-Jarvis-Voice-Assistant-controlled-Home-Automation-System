# This Arduino based basic Voice controlled Home Automation System
inspired by Iron Man's AI Intelligence(JARVIS), which uses microcontroller(Arduino),
relay switches, bluetooth module, led's, etc and controlled by users voice command
with Jarvis AI intelligence.

# Basically it uses HC 05 bluetooth module which get paired and connected with any
android device from which you want to controll your home automation system after
getting connected, it recognizes command spoken by user and works according to the
program and sends signals to microcontroller(Arduino) after reciving signals Arduino
works according to main program and trun relay switches on or of, according to voice
command of user and main source code of this project.

# That's it this the basic working principle of this project:)
